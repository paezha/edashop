## INDUSTRY READINESS

#' Database for Industry Readiness Index 4.0.
#'
#' A database with 101 indicators aggregated to NUTS 2 statistical level. Data were collected from open sources by
#' Honti, Czvetko, and Janos (2020). The sources include data from the fields of education (ETER, Erasmus), science (USPTO, MA-Graph, GRID),
#' government (Eurostat) and media coverage (GDELT). Indicators consider the I4.0-specific domain of higher education and lifelong learning,
#' innovation, technological investment, labour market and technological readiness as indicators. The variables on this table are the input for the
#' Industrial Readiness Index 4.0.

## PHD ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ITALY

#' A qualitative survey on Ph.D. entrepreneurship in Italy.
#'
#' Data from a survey on Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) entrepreneurship in Italy.
#' The data includes (i) information on Ph.D. students who could graduate between 2008 and 2014; (ii) background information on Italian academic
#' institutions attended by students. The database includes the responses of 906 students. Students provided information on their employment
#' condition, on their family background and opinions on the Ph.D. course and the institution they attended. Information on regional characteristics
#' and on university policies are also included.
#'
#' The original data set by Muscio and Ramaciotti (2018) was modified to convert some variables to factors. In addition, missing values that could
#' were imputed when it was clear what their values were (e.g., name of region was missing, but Rome:Lazio)
